# 05 - Approve and promote to lab Production

**Time:** 15 minutes plus Spark startup.
**Starting point:** [04 Test](./04-deploy-test.md) passed.
**Goal:** release the tested definition with an explicit human decision.

## 1. Assemble the release evidence

Before deploying, collect:

- The merged PR URL and commit SHA on `main`.
- Passing **validate** run.
- Successful Development -> Test operation.
- Test notebook PASS line and the printed Test workspace.
- The exact destination and item list for this promotion.

If any evidence is missing, stop. Do not promote based only on "the chat said it worked."

## 2. Preview Test -> Production

1. Open your workshop deployment pipeline.
2. Confirm the source is **Test**, not Development.
3. Confirm Production is **your disposable lab Production workspace**.
4. Compare stages in the portal.
5. Because this is Production's first deployment, select **both `lh_workshop`
   and `nb_workshop`**. Do not select only the notebook into an empty target.
6. Explain that no customer data, capacity changes or permissions are involved.

**Copilot prompt**

> We are in lab 05. Present the PR/check/Test evidence and preview deploying only
> lh_workshop and nb_workshop from Test to my lab Production stage. Do not execute
> until I say "approve production". After deployment, report the terminal result.
> Check the Production notebook binding before asking approval to run it.

## 3. Approve and deploy

After review, type **approve production** in chat or give the presenter your
explicit approval if using the portal. Then:

1. Execute Test -> Production, note `approved workshop release 1` if available.
2. Wait until the deployment operation succeeds.
3. Inspect operation details for both items.
4. In Production, open the **deployed** notebook, not a newly imported copy.
5. Confirm it says `RELEASE = "tax"`.

This approval is a workshop habit. It does **not** prevent another authorized
person from deploying through the portal/API. Enforced approvals, restricted
identities and GitHub environment protection are advanced follow-on work.

## 4. Verify Production independently

1. Inspect the default lakehouse. It must be Production's `lh_workshop`.
2. If a binding adjustment is needed, record it, save, and restart the session.
3. Confirm schemas are enabled and `dbo` exists.
4. Separately approve the run that overwrites Production's synthetic table.
5. Run all.
6. Verify the printed **Production** workspace and:

   ```text
   PASS: release=tax; rows=3; amount=350.00; amount_with_tax=385.00
   ```

7. Confirm the table contains Online 110.00, Store 220.00 and Partner 55.00
   in `amount_with_tax`.
8. Review deployment history and retain the release evidence without tokens.

**Done when:** the approved Test -> Production operation succeeded and
Production's own persisted data passed all checks.

**If blocked:** keep the failed operation details and correct the cause before
an approved retry. Do not bypass Test by deploying directly from Dev, create a
second copy of the notebook, or alter the data to fake a passing result.

Next: [06 recovery and cleanup](./06-recovery-and-cleanup.md).
