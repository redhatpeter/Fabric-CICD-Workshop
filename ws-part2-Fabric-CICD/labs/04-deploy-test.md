# 04 - Selectively deploy the notebook to Test

**Time:** 20 minutes.
**Starting point:** [03 change and PR](./03-change-and-pr.md) complete.
**Goal:** promote the reviewed definition without redeploying unrelated items.

## 1. Confirm the before state

1. Local `main` and Dev are at the reviewed tax release.
2. The GitHub validation run for the merged commit passed.
3. Open **Test's notebook** and confirm `RELEASE = "baseline"`.
4. Confirm Test already has its lakehouse from lab 01.
5. Record the current Test notebook item ID from its URL or item details.
   Use the same ID after deployment to show it was updated rather than duplicated.

Do not edit Test to create the tax feature. The release source is Dev.

## 2. Preview the release

In `wk-pipeline-<suffix>`:

1. Confirm Development is your Dev workspace and Test is your Test workspace.
2. Compare the stages in the portal.
3. Select **only `nb_workshop`** for Development -> Test.
4. Confirm `lh_workshop` is already present/paired in Test.
5. Review the destination, item selection and overwrite warning.

**Copilot alternative**

> Read my pipeline/stages/items and preview a selective deployment of only
> nb_workshop from Development to Test. Confirm the lakehouse dependency already
> exists and is paired in Test. Use an explicit items list; do not deploy all
> items. Wait for approval. Poll the resulting operation with a bounded timeout,
> reporting Failed/Canceled/timeout explicitly. Do not start a second operation
> while the first is running. Do not deploy to Production.

Item lists show identity/pairing, not a reliable definition-change status.
Use portal Compare or a normalized definition diff. A last-deployment timestamp
does not prove an item has or has not been edited.

## 3. Deploy and inspect the operation

1. Approve the reviewed notebook-only deployment.
2. Deploy with note `sales tax release to Test`, if available.
3. Wait for a terminal **Succeeded** result.
4. Open deployment history/details and verify the actual selected item and result.
5. Confirm the Test notebook keeps its existing item ID.
6. Confirm there is one `nb_workshop`, not a duplicate.

An API HTTP 202 means **accepted**, not deployed. A timeout means unresolved,
not success or permission to submit another deployment.

## 4. Run Test's persisted-data checks

1. Open the existing Test notebook.
2. Confirm `RELEASE = "tax"`.
3. Check its default lakehouse belongs to **Test**.
4. If binding is missing/wrong, stop, record it, attach Test's `lh_workshop`,
   save and restart the interactive session before running.
5. Approve overwriting only Test's `dbo.sales_wk`.
6. Run all and verify:

   ```text
   PASS: release=tax; rows=3; amount=350.00; amount_with_tax=385.00
   ```

7. Verify the printed workspace ID/name is Test's and the displayed rows match
   [lab 03's expected table](./03-change-and-pr.md#5-smoke-test-the-branch-workspace-before-merge).
8. Review the operation history: baseline deployment, then notebook-only update.

Definitions deploy; data stays as it was until the notebook runs. Before this
run, a baseline table in Test is expected even though its notebook is already tax.

**Done when:** operation succeeded, only the notebook was selected, its item ID
is unchanged, and Test's persisted table passes tax checks.

**If blocked:** inspect the deployment error and dependencies. Do not reimport a
notebook, manually edit Test's business logic, or unassign a stage to force success.
Those actions hide the release problem rather than fix it.

Next: [05 Production](./05-promote-production.md).
