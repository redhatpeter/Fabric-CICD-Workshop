# 01 - Create and deploy the working baseline

**Time:** 30 minutes plus Spark startup.
**Starting point:** [00 readiness](./00-readiness.md) passes.
**Goal:** establish baseline in Dev and Test before changing any code.

## 1. Create three disposable workspaces

In the Fabric portal:

1. Open **Workspaces > New workspace**.
2. Create your `wk-dev-<suffix>`, `wk-test-<suffix>` and `wk-prod-<suffix>`.
3. Assign each to your approved **existing active capacity**.
4. Confirm you have Admin on each and that Test/Production contain no user-created items.
5. Leave all three disconnected from Git for now.

Do not use My workspace, a shared production workspace, or an existing workspace
with unrelated content.

**Copilot alternative**

> List my workspaces and available capacities first. Preview creating only my
> Dev, Test and lab Production workspaces on the capacity in my config.
> Reuse only resources verified to belong to this lab. Do not resume a paused
> capacity or change permissions. Wait for approval, then create and verify.

## 2. Import the notebook and attach its lakehouse

In **Dev**:

1. Create a **Lakehouse** named `lh_workshop`.
2. Ensure **Lakehouse schemas** are enabled. Verify the Tables area contains
   the `dbo` schema. If not, stop and create a fresh schema-enabled workshop
   lakehouse; do not try to convert a shared one during the lab.
3. Return to the workspace and choose **Import notebook > From this computer**
   (the menu may be under **New item**).
4. Select your local `notebooks/nb_workshop.ipynb`.
5. Confirm the imported item is named exactly `nb_workshop`; rename only the
   new workshop item if the import added a suffix.
6. Open it with **PySpark** selected.
7. In its lakehouse/Explorer pane, add **Dev's `lh_workshop`** and set it as
   the **default** lakehouse.
8. Save. If a Spark session already started before binding, stop that interactive
   session and start a fresh one.

Do not upload the CSV. The notebook embeds the identical three rows so network
access and file paths cannot derail the CI/CD exercise.

## 3. Run and verify Dev

1. Read the notebook's overwrite warning.
2. Confirm you are in **Dev**, not another workspace.
3. Inspect the default lakehouse: it must be `lh_workshop` **in Dev**.
4. Approve overwriting only the synthetic `dbo.sales_wk` table.
5. Select **Run all** once; wait for the existing run to finish.
6. Verify the printed workspace name/ID and lakehouse name/ID are Dev's.
7. Expect:

   ```text
   PASS: release=baseline; rows=3; amount=350.00
   ```

Expected table:

| channel | amount |
| --- | --- |
| Online | 100.00 |
| Partner | 50.00 |
| Store | 200.00 |

Open the lakehouse and refresh the Tables view to see `dbo.sales_wk`.
The notebook reads the **persisted** table to verify exact rows, columns and
total; a green cell alone is not the acceptance check.

## 4. Set up the deployment pipeline

1. Open **Deployment pipelines** from Fabric navigation.
2. Create `wk-pipeline-<suffix>` with ordered stages **Development**, **Test**,
   **Production**.
3. Assign your Dev workspace to Development, Test workspace to Test, and
   lab Production workspace to Production.
4. Check the three workspace names before saving.
5. Confirm you are pipeline Admin. Pipeline permissions are separate from
   workspace permissions.

For Copilot, request a read-only inventory first, then a preview of the pipeline
and assignments. Resolve actual IDs from lists; never invent GUIDs.

## 5. Deploy the baseline to Test

1. In the pipeline, inspect Development's items.
2. Select **both `lh_workshop` and `nb_workshop`** for Development -> Test.
   The automatically generated SQL analytics endpoint is not a separate selection.
3. Review the direction, destination and selected items.
4. Approve and deploy, using note `baseline to Test` if a note field is available.
5. Wait for completion and inspect the operation/history result.
6. In **Test**, open the deployed notebook. Do **not** import another copy.
7. Confirm its default lakehouse is **Test's** `lh_workshop`, not Dev's.
   If missing/wrong, stop before running, attach Test's copy, save and restart
   the interactive session. Record this binding adjustment for the presenter.
8. Check that Test's lakehouse has schemas enabled and `dbo` available.
9. After approving the target overwrite, **Run all** and expect the same baseline
   PASS line, with **Test's** workspace printed.

The notebook's cross-workspace guard blocks accidental writes back into Dev,
but binding must still be inspected before every target run.

**Copilot prompt**

> Preview deploying only lh_workshop and nb_workshop from Development to Test
> in my workshop pipeline. Wait for my approval. Track the deployment to a
> terminal result with a bounded timeout; report any failure instead of retrying.
> Confirm target notebook/lakehouse binding before proposing a run. Do not deploy
> to Production or assume table rows were copied.

**Done when:** Dev and Test both pass baseline checks; Production is still empty.
Record the baseline deployment in your notes or screenshots.

**If blocked:** check capacity, both permission systems and item support. A newly
assigned workspace can need time to initialize; inspect the failed operation
before an approved retry. Never unassign/reassign a stage as a quick fix: that
can destroy deployment history and rules.

Next: [02 Git and branch](./02-git-and-branch.md).
